Birdwatching, often referred to as birding, is a delightful pastime that connects enthusiasts with the natural world. It involves observing and identifying birds in their natural habitats, whether it be in lush forests, serene wetlands, or bustling urban parks. Birdwatchers equip themselves with binoculars, field guides, and sometimes cameras to capture the beauty of these winged creatures.
